## Computers
CC: Tweaked is a mod for Minecraft which adds programmable computers, turtles and more to the game. A fork of the
much-beloved ComputerCraft, it continues its legacy with improved performance and stability, along with a wealth of new
features.

### features
Controlled using the [Lua programming language](https://www.lua.org/), CC: Tweaked's computers provides all the tools you need to start writing
code and automating your Minecraft world.

While computers are incredibly powerful, they're rather limited by their inability to move about. Turtles are the
solution here. They can move about the world, placing and breaking blocks, swinging a sword to protect you from zombies,
or whatever else you program them to!

Not all problems can be solved with a pickaxe though, and so CC: Tweaked also provides a bunch of additional peripherals
for your computers. You can play a tune with speakers, display text or images on a monitor, connect all your computers
together with modems, and much more.

Computers can now also interact with inventories such as chests, allowing you to build complex inventory and item
management systems.

little daunting getting started. Thankfully, there's several fantastic tutorials out there:
